\chapter{Loose ends}

Unfortunately there are many structural questions on $Wk(W, \theta)$ left unanswered. We will list some conjectures here without any further explanation.

\begin{conj}
	If $|S| \leq 4$, then 3-residually connectedness holds.
\end{conj}

\begin{conj}
	If $W$ is of type $A_n$, then 3-residually connectedness holds.
\end{conj}

The following conjectures are not directly related to 3-residually connectedness, but might be useful when trying to answer some of the open questions of 3-residually connectedness.

\begin{conj}
	Let $w \in \ti{\theta}$ and suppose $w \ul s = w \ul t$ for two distinct $s,t \in D_R(w)$. Then there are no two distinct $s',t' \in S \setminus D_R(w)$ with $w \ul s' = w \ul t'$.
\end{conj}

\begin{conj}
	Let $w \prec v \in \ti{\theta}$ such that $w$ and $v$ can be connected by exactly two distinct geodesics (note, that geodesics only consider the vertices, not the edges between the vertices). Then there are two distinct generators $s,t \in S$ such that the interval $[w,v]_\preceq$ coincides with the rank-2-residue $w C_{\{s,t\}}$.
\end{conj}

Last but not least it might be the case that 3-residually connectedness holds for any $Wk(W, \theta)$. We will not put this as a conjecture here, since some unpleasant phenomena need Coxeter groups of huge rank to occur and due to the limitations of our computational approach we could only investigate Coxeter groups of small rank.
