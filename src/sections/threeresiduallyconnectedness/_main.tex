\begin{defi}
	\typedlabel{defi:3rc}
	Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system and $\theta : W \to W$ an automorphism of $W$ with $\theta^2 = \id$ and $\theta(S) = S$. We call $Wk(\theta)$ \defword{3-residually connected} if the following holds: For every possible spherical $K \subseteq S$ with $\theta(K) = K$ and every $S_1,S_2,S_3 \subseteq S$ with pairwise non-empty intersection the statement

	\end{axioms}
	holds, whereas $w_K$ denotes the longest element in $\langle K \rangle$, $S_{ij} = S_i \cap S_j$ and $T = S_1 \cap S_2 \cap S_3$.

For arbitrary sets $S_{12},S_{23},S_{31}$ that do not come from pairwise intersections it is easy to find pairs of Coxeter systems and Coxeter system automorphism that do not satisfy the (modified) 3-residually connectedness, as seen in \ref{exam:trivial-counterexample-for-arbitary-sets-of-generators}. The following proposition shows us, what distinguishes our special configuration of sets of generators from the arbitrary configuration.

\begin{prop}
	\typedlabel{prop:three-sets-pairwise-intersection}
	Let $M$ be a set and $S_{12},S_{23},S_{31} \subseteq M$ three subsets. Then there are three sets $S_1,S_2,S_3 \subseteq M$ with $S_{ij} = S_i \cap S_j$ iff no element $x \in M$ is precisely in two of the sets $S_{ij}$.

	\begin{proof}
		Let $S_{12},S_{23},S_{31}$ be the pairwise intersection of three sets $S_1,S_2,S_3$. If an element $x \in M$ is in none or in one of the sets $S_i$, then it is in none of the sets $S_{ij}$. If it is in two of the sets $S_i$, say $x \in S_1,S_2$, then $x \in S_{12}$, but $x$ is not in one of the other two $S_{ij}$. If $x$ is in all three $S_i$, then it is in all three $S_{ij}$, too. Hence there is no $x \in M$, that is in precisely two of the sets $S_{ij}$. Conversely, suppose $S_{12},S_{23},S_{31}$ to be arbitrary with the constraint, that there is no element $x \in M$ in precisely two of them. Then we can construct three sets $S_1,S_2,S_3$, whose pairwise intersections coincides with the sets $S_{ij}$ by $x \in S_i \wedge x \in S_j$ iff $x \in S_{ij}$. With this construction and the previous considerations, it is clear that these $S_i$ have the $S_{ij}$ as pairwise intersection. Note that this construction is not unique in general, since when there is a $x \in M$, that is in none of the sets $S_{ij}$, then we could add it to $S_1$, $S_2$ or $S_3$ or just omit it without changing there pairwise intersection.
	\end{proof}
