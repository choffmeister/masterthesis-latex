\section{Coxeter groups}
\label{sec:coxeter-groups}

A Coxeter group, named after Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter, is an abstract group generated by involutions with specific relations between these generators. A simple class of a Coxeter groups are the symmetry groups of regular polyhedras in the Euclidean space.

The symmetry group of the square for example can be generated by two reflections $s,t$, whose stabilized hyperplanes enclose an angle of $\pi / 4$. In this case the map $st$ is a rotation in the plane by $\pi / 2$. So we have $s^2 = t^2 = (st)^4 = \id$. In fact this reflection group is determined up to isomorphy by $s,t$ and these three relations \cite[Theorem 1.9]{humphreys:coxeter}. Furthermore it turns out, that the finite reflection groups in the Euclidean space are precisely the finite Coxeter groups \cite[Theorem 6.4]{humphreys:coxeter}.

In this chapter we will compile some basic facts on Coxeter groups, based on \cite{humphreys:coxeter}.

\subsection{Introduction to Coxeter groups}

\begin{defi}
	\typedlabel{defi:coxeter-system}
	Let $S = \{ s_1, \ldots, s_n \}$ be a finite set of symbols and
	$$R = \{ m_{ij} \in \nn \cup \infty : 1 \leq i,j \leq n \}$$
	a set numbers (or $\infty$) with $m_{ii} = 1$, $m_{ij} > 1$ for $i \neq j$ and $m_{ij} = m_{ji}$. Then the free represented group
	$$W = \langle S \ | \ (s_i s_j)^{m_{ij}} \rangle$$
	is called a \defword{Coxeter group} and $(W,S)$ the corrosponding \defword{Coxeter system}. The cardinality of $S$ is called the \defword{rank} of the Coxeter system (and the Coxeter group).
\end{defi}

From the definiton we see, that Coxeter groups only depend on the cardinality of $S$ and the relations between the generators in $S$. A common way to visualize this information are Coxeter graphs.

\begin{defi}
	\typedlabel{defi:coxeter-graph}
	Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system. Create a graph by adding a vertex for each generator in $S$. Let $(s_i s_j)^m = 1$. In case $m = 2$ the two corrosponding vertices have no connecting edge. In case $m = 3$ they are connected by an unlabed edge. For $m > 3$ they have an connecting edge with label $m$. This graph we call the \defword{Coxeter graph} of our Coxeter system $(W,S)$.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}
	For an arbitrary element $w \in W$, $(W,S)$ a Coxeter system, we call a product $s_{i_1} \cdots s_{i_n} = w$ of generators $s_{i_1} \ldots s_{i_n} \in S$ an \defword{expression} of $w$. Any expression that can be obtained from $s_{i_1} \cdots s_{i_n}$ by omitting some (or all) factors is called a \defword{subexpression} of $w$.
\end{defi}

The present relations between the generators of a Coxeter group allow us to rewrite expressions. Hence an element $w \in W$ can have more than one expression. Obviously any element $w \in W$ has infinitly many expressions, since any expression $s_{i_1} \cdots s_{i_n} = w$ can be extended by applying $s_1^2 = 1$ from the right. But there must be a smallest number of generators needed to receive $w$. For example the neutral element $e$ can be expressed by the empty expression. Or each generator $s_i \in S$ can be expressed by itself, but any expression with less factors (i.e. the empty expression) is unequal to $s_i$.

\begin{defi}
	\typedlabel{defi:length-function}
	Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system and $w \in W$ an element. Then there are some (not neseccarily distince) generators $s_i \in S$ with $s_1 \cdots s_r = w$. We call $r$ the \defword{expression length}. The smallest number $r \in \nn_0$ for that $w$ has an expression of length $r$ is called the \defword{length} of $w$ and each expression of $w$, that is ob minimal length, is called \defword{reduced expression}. The map
	$$ l : W \to \nn_0 $$
	that maps each element in $W$ to its length is called \defword{length function}.
\end{defi}

\subsection{Exchange and Deletion Condition}

We now obtain a way to get a reduced expression of an arbitrary element $s_1 \cdots s_r = w \in W$. But first we define what a reflection is. Any element $w \in W$ that is conjugated to an generator $s \in S$ is called \defword{reflection}. Hence the set of all reflections in $W$ is
$$ T = \bigcup_{w \in W} wSw^{-1}. $$

\begin{theo}[Strong Exchange Condition]
	\namedlabel{theo:strong-exchange-condition}
	Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system, $w \in W$ an arbitrary element and ${s_1 \cdots s_r = w}$ with $s_i \in S$ a not neseccarily reduced expression for $w$. For each reflection $t \in T$ with $l(wt) < l(w)$ there exists an index $i$ for which $wt = s_1 \cdots \hat s_i \cdots s_r$, where $\hat s_i$ means omission. In case we started from a reduced expression, then $i$ is unique.

	\begin{proof}
		See \cite[Theorem 5.8]{humphreys:coxeter}.
	\end{proof}
\end{theo}

The \ref{theo:strong-exchange-condition} can be weaken when insisting on $t \in S$ to receive the following corollary.

\begin{coro}[Exchange Condition]
	\namedlabel{coro:exchange-condition}
	Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system, $w \in W$ an arbitrary element and ${s_1 \cdots s_r = w}$ with $s_i \in S$ a not neseccarily reduced expression for $w$. For each generator $s \in S$ with $l(ws) < l(w)$ there exists an index $i$ for which $ws = s_1 \cdots \hat s_i \cdots s_r$, where $\hat s_i$ means omission.

	\begin{proof}
		Directly from \ref{theo:strong-exchange-condition}.
	\end{proof}
\end{coro}

The \ref{coro:exchange-condition} immediatly yields another corollary for Coxeter groups:

\begin{coro}[Deletion Condition]
	\namedlabel{coro:deletion-condition}
	Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system, $w \in W$ and $w = s_1 \cdots s_r$ with $s_i \in S$ a unreduced expression of $w$. Then there exist two indices $i,j \in \{1,\cdots,r\}$ with $i < j$, such that $w = s_1 \cdots \hat s_i \cdots \hat s_j \cdots s_r$, where $\hat s_i$ and $\hat s_j$ mean omission.

	\begin{proof}
		Since the expression is unreduced there must be an index $j$ for that the twisted length shrinks. That means for $w' = s_1 \cdots s_{j-1}$ is $l(w' s_j) < l(w')$. Using the \ref{coro:exchange-condition} we get $w' s_j = s_1 \cdots \hat s_i \cdots s_{j-1}$ yielding $w = s_1 \cdots \hat s_i \cdots \hat s_j \cdots s_r$.
	\end{proof}
\end{coro}

This corollary is called \defword{Deletion Condition} and allows us to reduce expressions, i.e. to find a subexpression that is reduced. Due to the Deletion Condition any unreduced expression can be reduced by omitting a even number of generators (we just have to apply the Deletion Condition inductively).

The \ref{theo:strong-exchange-condition}, the \ref{coro:exchange-condition} and the \ref{coro:deletion-condition}, are some of the most powerful tools when investigating properties of Coxeter groups. We can use the second to prove a very handy property of Coxeter groups. The intersection of two parabolic subgroups is again a parabolic subgroup.

\begin{defi}
	\typedlabel{defi:parabolic-subgroup}
	Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system. For a subset of generators $I \subset S$ we call the subgroup $W_I \leq W$ that is generated by the elements in $I$ with the corrosponding relations a \defword{parabolic subgroup} of $W$.
\end{defi}

\begin{lemm}
	Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system and $I,J \subset S$ two subsets of generators. Then ${W_I \cap W_J} = W_{I \cap J}$.

	\begin{proof}
		Let $w \in W_{I \cap J}$. Then $w \in W_I$ and $w \in W_J$. To show the other inclusion we induce over the length $r$. For $r = 0$ we have $w = e$ and so $w \in W_{S'}$ for any $S' \subset S$. So suppose we have proven the assumption for all lengths up to $r-1$. Let $w \in W_I \cap W_J$ with $l(w) = r$. Then we have two reduced expressions $w = s_1 \cdots s_r = t_1 \cdots t_r$ with $s_i \in I$ and $t_i \in J$. By applying $s_r$ from the right we get $w s_r = s_1 \cdots s_{r-1} = t_1 \cdots t_r s_r$. The expression $t_1 \cdots t_r s_r$ is of length $r-1$, so \ref{coro:exchange-condition} yields $w s_r = s_1 \cdots s_{r-1} = t_1 \cdots \hat t_i \cdots t_r$, hence $w s_r \in W_I \cap W_J$. Due to induction we know that $w s_r \in W_{I \cap J}$. TODO
	\end{proof}
\end{lemm}

\subsection{Finite Coxeter groups}

Coxeter groups can be finite and infinite. A simple example for the former category is the following. Let $S = \{ s \}$. Due to definition it must be $s^2 = e$. So $W$ is isomorph to $\zz_2$ and finite. An example for an infinite Coxeter group can be obtained from $S = \{s,t\}$ with $s^2=t^2=e$ and $(st)^\infty = e$ (so we have no relation between $s$ and $t$). Obviously the element $st$ has infinite order forcing $W$ to be infinite. But there are also infinite Coxeter groups without an $\infty$-relation between two generators. An example for this is $W$ obtained from $S=\{s_1,s_2,s_3\}$ with $s_1^2=s_2^2=s_3^2=(s_1 s_2)^3=(s_2 s_3)^3=(s_3 s_1)^3=e$. But how can it be seen that this $W$ is infinite?

To provide a general answer to this question we fallback to a certain class of Coxeter groups, the irreducible ones.

\begin{defi}
	\typedlabel{defi:irreducible-coxeter-system}
	A Coxeter system is called \defword{irreducible}, if the corrosponding Coxeter graph is connected. Else it is called \defword{reducible}.
\end{defi}

If a Coxeter system is reducible, then its graph has more than one connection component and each connection component corrosponds to a parabolic subgroup of $W$. 

\begin{prop}
	\typedlabel{prop:reducible-coxeter-systems-isomorph-to-parabolic-subgroups}
	Let $(W,S)$ be a reducible Coxeter system. Then there exists a partition of $S$ into $I,J$ with $(s_i s_j)^2 = e$ whenever $s_i \in I, s_j \in J$ and $W$ is isomorph to the direct product of the two parabolic subgroups $W_I$ and $W_J$.

	\begin{proof}
		See \cite[Proposition 6.1]{humphreys:coxeter}.
	\end{proof}
\end{prop}

This proposition tells us, that an arbitray Coxeter system is finite iff its irreducible parabolic subgroups are finite. Therefor we can indeed fallback to irreducible Coxeter systems without loss of generality. If we could categorize all irreducible finite Coxeter systems, we could categorize all finite Coxeter systems. This is done by the following theorem:

\begin{figure}

	\tikzstyle{vertex}=[draw,thick,circle,minimum size=2mm,inner sep=0pt]

	\caption{All types of irreducible finite Coxeter systems}
	\label{fig:finite-coxeter-systems}
\end{figure}

\begin{theo}
	\typedlabel{theo:irreducible-finit-coxeter-systems}
	The irreducible finite Coxeter systems are exactly the ones in Figure~\ref{fig:finite-coxeter-systems}.

	\begin{proof}
		\cite[Theorem 6.4]{humphreys:coxeter}
	\end{proof}
\end{theo}

Finally we can decide with ease, if a given Coxeter system is finite. Take its irreducible parabolic subgroups and check, if each is one of $A_n$, $B_n$, $D_n$, $E_6$, $E_7$, $E_8$, $F_4$, $H_3$, $H_4$ or $I_2(m)$.
