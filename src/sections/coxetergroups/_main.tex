\section{Coxeter groups}
\label{sec:coxeter-groups}

A Coxeter group, named after Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter, is an abstract group generated by involutions with specific relations between these generators. A simple class of a Coxeter groups are the symmetry groups of regular polyhedras in the Euclidean space.

The symmetry group of the square for example can be generated by two reflections $s,t$, whose stabilized hyperplanes enclose an angle of $\pi / 4$. In this case the map $st$ is a rotation in the plane by $\pi / 2$. So we have $s^2 = t^2 = (st)^4 = \id$. In fact this reflection group is determined up to isomorphy by $s,t$ and these three relations \cite[Theorem 1.9]{humphreys:coxeter}. Furthermore it turns out, that the finite reflection groups in the Euclidean space are precisely the finite Coxeter groups \cite[Theorem 6.4]{humphreys:coxeter}.

In this chapter we will compile some basic facts on Coxeter groups, based on \cite{humphreys:coxeter}.
