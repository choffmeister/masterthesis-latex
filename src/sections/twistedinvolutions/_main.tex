\section{Twisted involutions in Coxeter groups}
\label{sec:twisted-involutions}

In this section our interest will focus on a certain subset of elements in Coxeter groups, the so called twisted involutions. From now on (and in the next sections) we will fix some symbols to have always the same meaning (some definitions will follow later):

\begin{enumerate}
	\item[$S$]				A set of generators, $S = \{ s_1, \ldots, s_n \}$.
	\item[$W$]				A Coxeter group with generators $S$.
	\item[$m_{ij}$]			The order of the element $(s_i s_j)$ in $W$.
	\item[$(W,S)$]			The Coxeter system obtained from $W$ and $S$.
	\item[$\theta$]			A Coxeter system automorphism of $(W,S)$ with $\theta^2 = \id$.
	\item[$\ti{\theta}$]	The set of twisted involutions of $W$ regarding $\theta$.
	\item[$\ul S$]			A set of symbols, $\ul S = \{ \ul s : s \in S \}$.
\end{enumerate}
