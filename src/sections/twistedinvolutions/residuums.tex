\label{sec:twisted-involutions-residuums}

\begin{defi}
	\typedlabel{defi:residuum}
	Let $w \in W$ and $I \subseteq S$ be a subset of generators. Then we define
	$$ wC_I := \{ w \ul s_1 \ldots \ul s_k : k \in \nn_0, s_i \in S \} $$
	as the \defword{$I$-residuum} of $w$ or just \defword{residuum}. To emphasize the size of $I$, say $|I| = n$, we also speak of a \defword{rank-$n$-residuum}.
\end{defi}

\begin{exam}
	Let $w \in W$. Then $wC_\emptyset = \{ w \}$ and $wC_S = \ti{\theta}$.
\end{exam}

\begin{lemm}
	\typedlabel{lemm:all-elements-of-one-residuum-yield-the-same-residuum}
	Let $w \in W$ and $I \subset S$. If $v \in wC_I$, then $vC_I = wC_I$.

	\begin{proof}
		Suppose $v \in wC_I$. Then $v = w \ul s_1 \ldots \ul s_n$ for some $s_i \in I$. Suppose $u = w \ul t_1 \ldots \ul t_m \in wC_I$ is any other element in $wC_I$ with $t_i \in I$. Then
		$$ u = w \ul t_1 \ldots \ul t_m = (v \ul s_n \ldots \ul s_1) \ul t_1 \ldots \ul t_m $$
		and so $u \in vC_I$. This yields $wC_I \subset vC_I$. Since $w \in vC_I$ we can swap $v$ and $w$ to get the other inclusion.
	\end{proof}
\end{lemm}

\begin{coro}
	Let $v, w \in W$ and $I \subset S$. Then either $vC_I \cap wC_I = \emptyset$ or $vC_I = wC_I$.

	\begin{proof}
		Immediately follows from \ref{lemm:all-elements-of-one-residuum-yield-the-same-residuum}.
	\end{proof}
\end{coro}

\begin{prop}
	\typedlabel{prop:residuums-have-unique-wk-theta-minimal-element}
	Let $w \in \ti{\theta}$, $I \subseteq S$ be a set of generators. Then there exists a unique element $w_0 \in wC_I$ with $w_0 \preceq w_0 \ul s$ for all $s \in I$.

	\begin{proof}
		Suppose there is no such element. Then for each $w \in wC_I$ we can find a $s \in I$ with $w' = w \ul s \preceq w$ and $e' \in wC_I$. By repetition \ref{prop:deletion-property-for-twisted-expressions} says, that $e \in wC_I$, but $e$ has the property, which we assumed, that no element in $wC_I$ has. Hence there must be at least one such element. Now suppose there are two distinct elements $u,v$ with the desired property. Note that this means, that $u$ and $w$ have no reduced twisted expression ending with some $\ul s \in I$. Let $v$ have a reduced twisted expression $v = \ul s_1 \ldots \ul s_k$. Since $u$ and $v$ are both in $wC_I$ there must be a twisted $v$-expression for $u$
		$$ u = v \ul s_{k+1} \ldots \ul s_{k+l} = \ul s_1 \ldots \ul s_{k+l} $$
		with $s_n \in I$ for $k+1 \leq n \leq k+l$. This twisted expression cannot be reduced, since it ends with $\ul s_{k+l} \in I$. Then \ref{prop:deletion-property-for-twisted-expressions} yields that this twisted expression contains a reduced twisted subexpression for $u$. It cannot end with $\ul s_n$ for $k+1 \leq n \leq k+l$. Hence it is a twisted subexpression of $\ul s_1 \ldots \ul s_k = v$, too. So $u \leq v$ by \ref{theo:bruhat-subexpression-characterization}. Because of symmetry it is also $v \leq u$ and so $u = v$, contradicting to our assumption $u \neq v$.
	\end{proof}
\end{prop}

\begin{coro}
	\typedlabel{coro:residuums-have-unique-minimal-element}
	Let $w \in \ti{\theta}$, $I \subseteq S$ be a set of generators and let $\rho_{min} := \{ \rho(v) : v \in wC_I \}$ be the minimal twisted length within the residuum $wC_I$. Then there is a unique element $w_{min} \in wC_I$ with $\rho(w_{min}) = \rho_{min}$. We denote this element with $\min(w,I)$.

	\begin{proof}
		The minimal rank $\rho_{min}$ exists, since $\rho : \ti{\theta} \to \nn_0$, $\nn_0$ is well-ordered and $wC_I \neq \emptyset$. Suppose we have an element $w_{min}$ with $\rho(w_{min}) = \rho_{min}$. This means, that in particular all $w_{min} \ul s$ with $s \in I$ must be of larger twisted length, i.e. $w_{min} < w_{min} \ul s$ for all $s \in I$. With \ref{prop:residuums-have-unique-wk-theta-minimal-element} this element must be unique.
	\end{proof}
\end{coro}

We proceed with some properties of rank-2-residuums. Our interest in these residuums steems from the fact, that their properties are needed later in Section \ref{sec:twisted-involutions-algorithms} to construct an effective algorithm for calculating the twisted weak ordering, i.e. calculating the Hasse diagram of $Wk(\theta)$ for arbitrary Coxeter systems $(W,S)$ and Coxeter system automorphisms $\theta$.

\begin{defi}
	Let $s,t \in S$ be two distinct generators. We define:
	$$[\ul s \ul t]^n :=
	\begin{cases}
	(\ul s \ul t)^{\frac{n}{2}} & n \textrm{ even}, \\
	(\ul s \ul t)^{\frac{n-1}{2}} \ul s & n \textrm{ odd}. 
	\end{cases}$$
\end{defi}

This definition lets us rewrite rank-2-residuums. Suppose we have an element $w \in \ti{\theta}$ and two distinct generators $s,t \in S$. Thanks to \ref{lemm:all-elements-of-one-residuum-yield-the-same-residuum} and \ref{coro:residuums-have-unique-minimal-element} we can assume, that $w = min(w,\{s,t\})$. Then
$$ wC_{\{s,t\}} = \{ w \} \ \cup \ \{ w [\ul s \ul t]^n : n \in \nn \} \ \cup \ \{ w [\ul t \ul s]^n : n \in \nn \}. $$
This encourages the following definition.

\begin{defi}
	Let $w \in \ti{\theta}$ and let $s,t \in S$ be two distinct generators. Suppose $w = min(w,\{s,t\})$. Then we call $\{ w [\ul s \ul t]^n : n \in \nn \}$ the \defword{$s$-branch} and $\{ w [\ul t \ul s]^n : n \in \nn \}$ the \defword{$t$-branch} of $wC_{\{s,t\}}$.
\end{defi}

One question arises immediately: Are the $s$- and the $t$-branch disjoint? With the following propositions, corollaries and lemmas we will get a much better idea of the structure of rank-2-residuums and answer this question.

\begin{prop}
	\typedlabel{prop:rank-2-residuums-are-convex}
	Let $w \in W$ and let $s,t \in S$ two distinct generators. Without loss of generality suppose $w = \min(w, \{s,t\})$. If there is a $v \in wC_{\{s,t\}}$ with $v \ul s \prec v$ and $v \ul t \prec v$, then it is the unique element with this property forcing $wC_{\{s,t\}}$ to consist of two geodesics from $w$ to $v$ intersecting only in this two elements. Else the $s$- and $t$-branch are disjoint, strictly ascending in twisted length and of infinite size.

	\begin{proof}
		Suppose there is a $v$ in the $s$-branch with $v \ul s \prec v$ and $v \ul t \prec v$, say $v = w[\ul s \ul t]^n$. Then $w[\ul s \ul t]^{m+1} \prec w[\ul s \ul t]^m$ for $n \leq m \leq 2m - 1$ and $w[\ul s \ul t]^{2n} = w$. This is because assuming the opposite would yield an element $u \neq w$ with $u \prec u \ul s$ and $u \prec u \ul t$ contradicting to the uniqueness from \ref{prop:residuums-have-unique-wk-theta-minimal-element}. If no such $v$ exists, then the $s$- and $t$-branch must be disjoint, strictly ascending in twisted length and so of infinite size.
	\end{proof}
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
	\typedlabel{prop:onesided-operations-only-at-top-or-bottom-end-of-twocycle}
	Let $w \in S$ and $s,t \in S$ two distinct generators. If $s$ operates onesided on $w$ and $w \ul s \prec w$, then either $w \ul{st} \prec w \ul{s}$ or $w \ul{t} \succ w$.

	\begin{proof}
		We have $\theta(s)ws = w$ and $s \in D_R(w)$. If $t \notin D_R(w)$, then we are done. So suppose $t \in D_R(w)$. This means $w \ul s \leq w$ and $w \ul t \leq w$ and \cite[Lemma 3.9]{hultman:comb-twisted-invo} yields $w \ul {st} < w$ and $w \ul {ts} < w$. If $t \in D_R(w \ul s)$, then we are done. So suppose $t \notin D_R(w \ul s)$. Then $t \in D_R(w \ul {st})$. Together with $w \ul {st} \leq w$ \cite[Lemma 3.9(2)]{hultman:comb-twisted-invo} says $(w \ul {st}) \ul t \leq w \ul t$. Finally we get
		$$ ws = w \ul s = (w \ul {st}) \ul t \leq w \ul t = wt.$$
		Since $w \ul s$ and $w \ul t$ are of same twisted length they have to be equal and therefore $s = t$ which contradicts to our assumption of two distinct generators $s$ and $t$. We now have $w \ul s \ul t < w \ul s$ or $w \ul t > w$ (in $\Br(\ti{\theta})$). Both cases can be transfered to the twisted weak ordering. If $w \ul s \ul t < w \ul s$, then $\rho(w \ul s \ul t) = \rho(w \ul s) - 1$ and $w \ul s \ul t \ul t = w \ul s$, yielding $w \ul s \ul t \prec w \ul s$. If $w \ul t > w$ then $\rho(w \ul t) = \rho(w) + 1$, yielding $w \ul t \succ w$.
	\end{proof}
\end{prop}

\begin{coro}
	\typedlabel{coro:onesided-operations-only-at-top-or-bottom-end-of-twocycle}
	Let $w \in S$ and let $s,t \in S$ be two distinct generators. If $w$ is neither the unique element in $wC_{\{s,t\}}$ of smallest twisted length,i.e. $\min(w,\{s,t\})$, nor the unique (but not necessarily existing) element of largest twisted length, then both $s$ and $t$ act twosided on $w$.

	\begin{proof}
		Follows immediately from \ref{prop:onesided-operations-only-at-top-or-bottom-end-of-twocycle}.
	\end{proof}
\end{coro}

\begin{lemm}
	\typedlabel{lemm:one-both-sided-action-symmetric-in-rank-2-residuums}
	Let $s,t \in S$ two distinct generators and $w \in S$ with $w = min(w,\{s,t\})$. Suppose $v = w [\ul s \ul t]^n$ with $v \ul s \prec v$ and $v \ul t \prec v$. Then the one- and bothsided actions are distributed axisymmetrically or pointsymmetrically like in Figure \ref{fig:dist-one-bothsided-actions-in-rank-2-residuum}.

		\label{fig:dist-one-bothsided-actions-in-rank-2-residuum}
	\end{figure}

	\begin{proof}
		If $u$ covers $w$, then there are only two edges and the assumption holds. So suppose $wC_{\{s,t\}}$ contains at least four edges. Due to \ref{coro:onesided-operations-only-at-top-or-bottom-end-of-twocycle} the onesided actions can only occure next to $w$ and $v$. Hence there are $2^4 = 16$ configurations possible. There are two geodesics from $w$ to $v$. Suppose they have a different count of onesided actions, say the first has $n$ and the second $m$ onesided actions, and $\rho(v) - \rho(w) = k$. Then
		$$ l(v) = l(w) + n + 2(k-n) \neq l(w) + m + 2(k-m) = l(v), $$
		which is obviously a contradiction. This wipes out ten out of the 16 configurations. The remaining are those from Figure \ref{fig:dist-one-bothsided-actions-in-rank-2-residuum}.
	\end{proof}
\end{lemm}

\begin{lemm}
	\typedlabel{lemm:max-twisted-circle-height}
	Let $w \in S$, $s,t \in S$ two distinct generators and $m = \ord(st) < \infty$. Then $|wC_{\{s,t\}}| \leq 2m$.

		\todo

\begin{exam}
	In Figure \ref{fig:a4_s1s3-and-a4_s2s4} we see two Hasse diagrams of $Wk(A_4, \id)$. The first only contains edges with label $s_1,s_3$ and the second only edges with label $s_2,s_4$.
