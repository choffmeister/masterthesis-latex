\subsection{Twisted weak ordering}
\label{sec:twisted-involutions-twisted-weak-ordering}

In this section we will introduce the twisted weak ordering $Wk(\theta)$ on Coxeter groups, or to be more precise, on $\ti{\theta}$.

\begin{defi}
	Let $\ti{\theta}$ be the set of twisted involutions. For $v,w \in \ti{\theta}$ we define $v \preceq w$ iff there are $\ul s_1, \ldots, \ul s_k \in \ul S$ with $w = v \ul{ s_1 \ldots s_k }$ and $\rho(v) = \rho(w) - k$. We denote the poset $(\ti{\theta},\preceq)$ with $Wk(\theta)$.
\end{defi}

\begin{lemm}
	The set $\ti{\theta}$ with the relation $\preceq$ is a graded poset with rank function $l^\theta$.

	\begin{proof}
		Follows immediatly from the definition of $\preceq$.
	\end{proof}
\end{lemm}

\begin{exam}
	In Figure \ref{fig:a4} we see Hasse diagram of $Wk(\id)$ on the involutions in the Coxeter group $A_4$. Solid edges represent bothsided actions and dashed edges represent onesided actions.

\end{exam}

\begin{defi}
	Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system and $w,u \in W$ with $\rho(u) - \rho(w) = n$. Each sequence $w = w_0 \prec w_1 \prec \ldots \prec w_n = u$ is called a \defword{geodesic} from $w$ to $u$.
\end{defi}
