\subsection{Twisted weak ordering}
\label{sec:twisted-involutions-twisted-weak-ordering}

In this section we introduce the twisted weak ordering $Wk(\theta)$ on the set $\ti{\theta}$ of $\theta$-twisted involutions.

\begin{defi}
	Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system and let $\ti{\theta}$ be the set of $\theta$-twisted involutions in $W$. For $v,w \in \ti{\theta}$ we define $v \preceq w$ iff there are $\ul s_1, \ldots, \ul s_k \in \ul S$ with $w = v \ul s_1 \ldots \ul s_k$ and $\rho(v) = \rho(w) - k$. We call the poset $(\ti{\theta},\preceq)$ \defword{twisted weak ordering}, denoted with $Wk(W, \theta)$. When the Coxeter group $W$ is clear from the context, we just write $Wk(\theta)$.
\end{defi}

\begin{lemm}
	The poset $Wk(\theta)$ is a graded poset with rank function $\rho$.

	\begin{proof}
		Follows immediately from the definition of $\preceq$.
	\end{proof}
\end{lemm}

\begin{exam}
	In Figure \ref{fig:a4} we see Hasse diagram of $Wk(A_4, \id)$. Solid edges represent bothsided actions and dashed edges represent onesided actions.

\end{exam}

\begin{defi}
	Let $v,w \in W$ with $\rho(w) - \rho(v) = n$. A sequence $v = w_0 \prec w_1 \prec \ldots \prec w_n = w$ is called a \defword{geodesic} from $v$ to $w$.
\end{defi}
