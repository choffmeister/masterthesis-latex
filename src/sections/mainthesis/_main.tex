	Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system, $\theta : W \to W$ an automorphism of $W$ with $\theta^2 = \id$ and $\theta(S) = S$, and $K \subset S$ a subset of $S$ generating a finite subgroup of $W$ with $\theta(K) = K$. Futhermore let $T,S_1,S_2,S_3 \subset S$ be four pairwise disjoint sets of generators. For which Coxeter groups $W$ does the implication
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:main}
		w \in w_K C_{T \cup S_i}, i=1,2,3 \Rightarrow w \in w_K C_T
	\end{equation}
	hold for any possible $K,\theta,T,S_1,S_2,S_3$ and $w$?
\end{ques}

The reader might wonder, why we handle with three sets $S_1,S_2,S_3$ and not just with two. The reason for that is also the main reason, why $Wk(\theta)$ is less accessible than $\Br(\ti{\theta})$: In $Wk(\theta)$ there is the possibilty for $w \ul s = w \ul t$ for two distinct generators $s,t \in S$. Within the Hasse diagram this situation appears in form of double edges between two vertices. For example, let $W = A_3$ and $\theta$ be the Coxeter system automorphism swapping $s_1$ with $s_3$. Then we have $e \ul s_1 = s_3 s_1 = s_1 s_3 = e \ul s_3$. Double edges can also occur for $\theta = \id$, but in this situation they cannot appear next to the neutral element $e$, since $\theta(s)es = e$ for all $s \in S$, hence $e \ul s = s \neq t = e \ul t$ for all $s,t \in S$ with $s \neq t$. Therefore, if we had written \ref{eq:main} with just two sets, then it would be false immediately for any Coxeter system automorphism, that swaps two commutating generators and presumably there could be found many more counterexamples.

By a couple of example we now further investigate some properties of the poset $Wk(\theta)$, that would be nice to have, but prove to be false. When applying the \ref{prop:exchanged-property-for-twisted-expressions} to a twisted expression, there is no hint which $\ul s_i$ can be omitted. Hence the following hypothesis would be very useful, but unfortunately it proves to be false for $Wk(\theta)$. Consider the following situation: Let $w \in \ti{\theta}$ and $w \ul s_1 \ldots \ul s_k = w \ul t_1 \ldots \ul t_k$ two reduced twisted expressions. Then in the twisted expression $w \ul s_1 \ldots \ldots \ul s_k \ul t_k$ we can omit the $\ul t_k$ and one other $\ul s$ by \ref{prop:exchanged-property-for-twisted-expressions} and get still the same element. It would be nice, when the second omitted $\ul s$ is one of the $\ul s_i$ in general, but unfortunately this proves to be false:

	Let $W = A_3$ and $w = \ul s_3$ as in Figure~\ref{fig:wk-prefix-counterexample}. Then $w \ul s_2 \ul s_1 \ul s_2 = w \ul s_1 \ul s_2 \ul s_3$, but $w \ul s_1 \ul s_2 \ul s_3 \ul s_2 \notin \{ w \ul s_1 \ul s_2, w \ul s_1 \ul s_3, w \ul s_2 \ul s_3 \}$.

	Let $w \in \ti{\theta}$ and $S_1,S_2,S_3 \subseteq S$. Then $wC_{S_1} \cap wC_{S_2} \cap wC_{S_3} = wC_{S_1 \cap S_2 \cap S_3}$ is not true in general.
