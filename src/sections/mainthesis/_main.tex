	Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system, $\theta : W \to W$ an automorphism of $W$ with $\theta^2 = \id$ and $\theta(S) = S$, and $K \subset S$ a subset of $S$ generating a finite subgroup of $W$ with $\theta(K) = K$. Denote the largest element in $\langle K \rangle \leq W$ by $w_K$. Futhermore let $S_1,S_2,S_3 \subset S$ be three sets of generators. Define $S_{ij} = S_i \cap S_j$ and $T = S_1 \cap S_2 \cap S_3$. For which Coxeter groups $W$ does the implication
	\begin{equation}

		\forall \ 1 \leq i < j \leq 3 : w \in w_K C_{S_{ij}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad w \in w_K C_T \tag*{($\ast$)}
	\end{equation}
	hold for any possible $K,\theta,S_1,S_2,S_3$ and $w$?

The reader might wonder, why we handle with intersections of sets of generators and not just with arbitrary sets of generators. The reason for that is also the main reason, why $Wk(\theta)$ is less accessible than $\Br(W)$: In $Wk(\theta)$ there is the possibilty for $w \ul s = w \ul t$ for two distinct generators $s,t \in S$. Within the Hasse diagram this situation appears in form of double edges between two vertices. For example, let $W = A_3$ and $\theta$ be the Coxeter system automorphism swapping $s_1$ with $s_3$. Then we have $e \ul s_1 = s_3 s_1 = s_1 s_3 = e \ul s_3$. Double edges can also occur for $\theta = \id$, but in this situation they cannot appear next to the neutral element $e$, since $\theta(s)es = e$ for all $s \in S$, hence $e \ul s = s \neq t = e \ul t$ for all $s,t \in S$ with $s \neq t$. Therefore, if we had written \ref{eq:main} with arbitrary sets $S_{12},S_{23},S_{31}$, then it would be false immediately for any Coxeter system automorphism, that swaps two commutating generators, as seen in \ref{exam:trivial-counterexample-for-arbitary-sets-of-generators}.

The following corollary shows us, what distinguishes our special configuration of sets of generators from the arbitrary configuration.

\begin{coro}
	\typedlabel{coro:three-sets-pairwise-intersection}
	Let $M$ be a set and $S_{12},S_{23},S_{31} \subseteq M$ three subsets. Then there are three sets $S_1,S_2,S_3 \subseteq M$ with $S_{ij} = S_i \cap S_j$ iff no element $x \in M$ is precisely in two of the sets $S_{ij}$.

	\begin{proof}
		Let $S_{12},S_{23},S_{31}$ be the pairwise intersection of three sets $S_1,S_2,S_3$. If an element $x \in M$ is in none or in one of the sets $S_i$, then it is in none of the sets $S_{ij}$. If it is in two of the sets $S_i$, say $x \in S_1,S_2$, then $x \in S_{12}$, but $x$ is not in one of the other two $S_{ij}$. If $x$ is in all three $S_i$, then it is in all three $S_{ij}$, too. Hence there is no $x \in M$, that is in precisely two of the sets $S_{ij}$. Conversely, suppose $S_{12},S_{23},S_{31}$ to be arbitrary with the constraint, that there is no element $x \in M$ in precisely two of them. Then we can construct three sets $S_1,S_2,S_3$, whose pairwise intersections coincides with the sets $S_{ij}$ by $x \in S_i \wedge x \in S_j$ iff $x \in S_{ij}$. With this construction and the previous considerations, it is clear that these $S_i$ have the $S_{ij}$ as pairwise intersection. Note that this construction is not unique in general, since when there is a $x \in M$, that is in none of the sets $S_{ij}$, then we could add it to $S_1$, $S_2$ or $S_3$ or just omit it without changing there pairwise intersection.
