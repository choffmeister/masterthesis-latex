\section{Bruhat ordering}
\label{sec:coxeter-groups-bruhat-ordering}

We now investigate ways to partially order the elements of a Coxeter group. Futhermore, this ordering should be compatible with the length function, i.e. for $w,v \in W$ we have $l(w) < l(v)$ whenever $w < v$.

\begin{defi}
	\typedlabel{defi:bruhat-ordering}
	Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system and $T = \cup_{w \in W} wSw^{-1}$ the set of all reflections in $W$. We write $w' \to w$ if there is a $t \in T$ with $w't = w$ and $l(w') < l(w)$. If there is a sequence $w' = w_0 \to w_1 \to \ldots \to w_m = w$, we say $w' < w$. The resulting relation $w' \leq w$ is called \defword{Bruhat ordering}, denoted by $\Br(W)$.
\end{defi}

\begin{lemm}
	\typedlabel{lemm:bruhat-ordering-is-poset}
	\theocite{Section 5.9}{humphreys:coxeter}
	Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system. Then $\Br(W)$ is a poset.

	\begin{proof}
		The Bruhat ordering is reflexive by definition. Since the elements in sequences $e \to w_1 \to w_2 \to \ldots$ are strictly ascending in length, it must be antisymmetric. By concatenation of sequences we get the transitivity.
	\end{proof}
\end{lemm}

We now show, that $Br(W)$ is graded. By definition we already have $v < w$ iff $l(v) < l(w)$, but its not that obvious that two immediately adjacent elements differ in length by exactly 1. Beforehand let us just mention two other partial orderings that are graded by definition:

\begin{defi}
	Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system. The ordering $\leq_R$ defined by $u \leq_R w$ iff $uv = w$ for some $u \in W$ with $l(u) + l(v) = l(w)$ is called the \defword{right weak ordering}. The left-sided version $u \leq_L w$ iff $vu = w$ is called the \defword{left weak ordering}.
\end{defi}

To ensure the Bruhat ordering is graded as well, we need another characterization of the Bruhat ordering in terms of subexpressions.

\begin{prop}
	\typedlabel{prop:u-leq-w-then-us-leq-w-or-us-leq-ws}
	\theocite{Proposition 5.9}{humphreys:coxeter}
	Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system, $u,w \in W$ with $u \leq w$ and $s \in S$. Then $us \leq w$ or $us \leq ws$ or both.

	\begin{proof}
		\proofcite{Proposition 5.9}{humphreys:coxeter}
		We can reduce the proof to the case $u \to w$, i.e. $ut = w$ for a $t \in T$ with $l(v) < l(u)$. Let $s = t$. Then $us \leq w$ and we are done. In case $s \neq t$ there are two alternatives for the lengths. We can have $l(us) = l(u) - 1$ which would mean $us \to u \to w$, so $us \leq w$. So assume $l(us) = l(u) + 1$. For the reflection $t' = sts$ we get $(us)t' = ussts = uts = ws$. So we have $us \leq ws$ iff $l(us) < l(ws)$. Suppose this is not the case. Since we have assumed $l(us) = l(u) + 1$ any reduced expression $u = s_1 \cdots s_r$ for $u$ yields a reduced expression $us = s_1 \cdots s_r s$ for $us$. With the \ref{theo:strong-exchange-condition} we can obtain $ws = ust'$ from $us$ by omitting one factor. This omitted factor cannot be $s$ since $s \neq t$. This means $ws = s_1 \cdots \hat s_i \cdots s_r s$ and so $ws = s_1 \cdots \hat s_i \cdots s_r$, contradicting to our assumption $l(u) < l(w)$.
	\end{proof}
\end{prop}

\begin{theo}[Subword property]
	\namedlabel{theo:bruhat-subexpression-characterization}
	\theocite{Theorem 5.10}{humphreys:coxeter}
	Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system and $w \in W$ with a fixed, but arbitrary, reduced expression $w = s_1 \cdots s_r$, $s_i \in S$. Then $u \leq w$ (in the Bruhat ordering) iff $u$ can be obtained as a subexpression of this reduced expression.

	\begin{proof}
		\proofcite{Theorem 5.10}{humphreys:coxeter}
		First we show that any $w' < w$ occurs as a subexpression. For that we start with the case $w' \to w$, say $w't = w$. We have $l(w') < l(w)$ and hence by \ref{theo:strong-exchange-condition} we get
		$$ w' = w'tt = wt = s_1 \cdots \hat s_i \cdots s_r $$
		for some $i$. This step can be iterated. In return, suppose we have a subexpression $w' = s_{i_1} \cdots s_{i_q}$. We induce on $r = l(w)$. For $r = 0$ we have $w = e$, hence $w' = e$, too and so $w' \leq w$. Now suppose $r > 0$. If $i_q < r$, then $s_{i_1} \cdots s_{i_q}$ is a subexpression of $w s_r = s_1 \cdots s_{r-1}$, too. Since $l(w s_r) = r-1 < r$, we can conclude
		$$ s_{i_1} \cdots s_{i_q} \leq s_1 \cdots s_{r-1} = w s_r < w $$
		by induction hypothesis. If $i_q = r$, then we use our induction hypothesis to get $s_{i_1} \cdots s_{i_{q-1}} \leq s_1 \cdots s_{r-1}$. By \ref{prop:u-leq-w-then-us-leq-w-or-us-leq-ws} we get
		$$ s_{i_1} \cdots s_{i_q} \leq s_1 \cdots s_{r-1} < w $$
		or
		$$ s_{i_1} \cdots s_{i_q} \leq s_1 \cdots s_r = w, $$
		both finishing our induction.
	\end{proof}
\end{theo}

\begin{coro}
	\typedlabel{coro:bruhat-intervals-are-finite}
	Let $u,w \in W$. Then the interval $[u,w]$ in the Bruhat order $\Br(W)$ is finite.

	\begin{proof}
		We have $[u,w] \subseteq [e,w]$. All elements $v \in [e,w]$ can be obtained as subexpressions of one fixed reduced expression for $w$. Let $s_1 \ldots s_k = w$ be such a reduced expression. Then there are at most $2^k$ many subexpressions, hence $[u,w]$ is finite.
	\end{proof}
\end{coro}

This characterization of the Bruhat ordering is very handy. With it and the following short lemma we will be in the position to show that $\Br(W)$ is graded with rank function $l$.

\begin{lemm}
	\typedlabel{lemm:dont-know}
	\theocite{Lemma 5.11}{humphreys:coxeter}
	Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system, $u,w \in W$ with $u < w$ and $l(w) = l(u) + 1$. In case there is a generator $s \in S$ with $u < us$ but $us \neq w$, then both $w < ws$ and $us < ws$.

	\begin{proof}
		\proofcite{Lemma 5.11}{humphreys:coxeter}
		Due to \ref{prop:u-leq-w-then-us-leq-w-or-us-leq-ws} we have $us \leq w$ or $us \leq ws$. Since $l(us) = l(w)$ and $us \neq w$ the first case is impossible. So $us \leq ws$ and because of $u \neq w$ already $us < ws$. In turn, $l(w) = l(us) < l(ws)$, forcing $w < ws$.
	\end{proof}
\end{lemm}

\begin{prop}
	\typedlabel{prop:bruhat-intervals}
	\theocite{Proposition 5.11}{humphreys:coxeter}
	Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system and $u < w$. Then there are elements $w_0,\ldots,w_m \in W$ such that $u = w_0 < w_1 < \ldots < w_m = w$ with $l(w_i) = l(w_{i-1}) + 1$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$.

	\begin{proof}
		\proofcite{Proposition 5.11}{humphreys:coxeter}
		We induce on $r = l(u) + l(w)$. In case $r = 1$ we have $u = e$ and $w = s$ for a $s \in S$ and are done. Conversely suppose $r > 1$. Then there is a reduced expression $w = s_1 \cdots s_r$ for $w$. Let us fix this expression. Then $l(w s_r) < l(w)$. Thanks to \ref{theo:bruhat-subexpression-characterization} there must be a subexpression of $w$ with $u = s_{i_1} \cdots s_{i_q}$ for some $i_1 < \ldots < i_q$. We distinguish between two cases:

		\begin{description}
			\item[$u < us$:] If $i_q = r$, then $us = s_{i_1} \cdots s_{i_q} s = s_{i_1} \cdots s_{i_{q-1}}$ which is also a subexpression of $ws$. This yields $u < us \leq ws < w$. Since $l(ws) < r$ there is, by induction, a sequence of the desired form. The last step from $ws$ to $w$ also differs in length by exactly 1, so we are done. If $i_q < r$ then $u$ is itself already a subexpression of $ws$ and we can again find a sequence from $u$ to $ws$ strictly ascending in length by 1 in each step and have one last step from $ws$ to $w$ also increasing in length by 1.
			\item[$us < u$:] Then by induction we can find a sequence from $us$ to $w$, say $us = w_0 < \ldots < w_m = w$, where the lengths of neighbored elements differ by exactly 1. Since $w_0 s = u > us = w_0$ and $w_m s = ws < w = w_m$ there must be a smallest index $i \geq 1$, such that $w_i s < w_i$, which we choose. Suppose $w_i \neq w_{i-1} s$. We have $w_{i-1} < w_{i-1}s \neq w_i$ and due to \ref{lemm:dont-know} we get $w_i < w_i s$. This contradicts to the minimality of $i$. So $w_i = w_{i-1} s$. For all $1 \leq j < i$ we have $w_j \neq w_{j-1} s$, because of $w_j < w_j s$. Again we apply \ref{lemm:dont-know} to receive $w_{j-1} s < w_j s$. Alltogether we can construct a sequence
			$$ u = w_0 s < w_1 s < \ldots < w_{i-1} s = w_i < w_{i+1} < \ldots w_m = w, $$
			which matches our assumption. \qedhere
		\end{description}
	\end{proof}
\end{prop}

\begin{coro}
	\typedlabel{coro:bruhat-ordering-is-graded}
	Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system and $\Br(W)$ the Bruhat ordering poset of $W$. Then $\Br(W)$ is graded with $l:W \to \nn$ as rank function.

	\begin{proof}
		Let $u,w \in W$ with $w$ covering $u$. Then \ref{prop:bruhat-intervals} says there is a sequence $u = w_0 < \ldots < w_m = w$ with $l(w_i) = l(w_{i-1}) + 1$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$. Since $w$ covers $u$ it must be $m = 1$ and so $u < w$ with $l(w) = l(u) + 1$.
	\end{proof}
\end{coro}

\begin{theo}[Lifting Property]
	\namedlabel{theo:lifting-property}
	\theocite{Theorem 1.1}{deodhar:bruhat-order}
	Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system and $v,w \in W$ with $v \leq w$. Suppose $s \in S$ with $s \in D_R(w)$. Then
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $vs \leq w$,
		\item $s \in D_R(v) \Rightarrow vs \leq ws$.
	\end{enumerate}

	\begin{proof}
		\proofcite{Theorem 1.1}{deodhar:bruhat-order}
		We use the alternative subexpression characterization of the Bruhat ordering from \ref{theo:bruhat-subexpression-characterization}.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Since $s \in D_R(w)$ there exists a reduced expression $w = s_1 \cdots s_r$ with $s_r = s$. Due to $v \leq w$ we can obtain $v$ as a subexpression $v = s_{i_1} \cdots s_{i_q}$ from $w$. If $i_q = r$ then $vs = s_{i_1} \cdots s_{i_q} s = s_{i_1} \cdots s_{i_{q - 1}}$ is also a subexpression of $w$. Else if $i_q \neq r$, then $v$ is a subexpression of $ws = s_1 \cdots s_{r-1}$ and so $vs$ is again a subexpression of $w = s_1 \cdots s_{r-1} s$. In both cases we get $vs \leq w$.
			\item If we additionally assume $s \in D_R(v)$ then we can always find a reduced expression $w = s_1 \cdots s_r$ with $s_r = s$ having $u = s_{i_1} \cdots s_{i_q}$ as subexpression with $s_{i_q} = s$. This yields $vs = s_{i_1} \cdots s_{i_{q-1}} \leq s_1 \cdots s_{r-1} = ws$. \qedhere
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proof}
\end{theo}

\begin{rema}
	Note that the \ref{theo:lifting-property} has an analogue left-sided version: Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system and $v,w \in W$ with $v \leq w$. Suppose $s \in S$ with $s \in D_L(w)$. Then
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $sv \leq w$,
		\item $s \in D_L(v) \Rightarrow sv \leq sw$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{rema}

The \ref{theo:lifting-property} seems quite innocent, but when trying to investigate facts around the Bruhat ordering it proves to be one of the key tools in many cases.

\begin{prop}
	\typedlabel{prop:bruhat-is-directed}
	\theocite{Proposition 7}{denton:coxeter}
	The poset $\Br(W)$ is directed.

	\begin{proof}
		\proofcite{Proposition 7}{denton:coxeter}
		Let $u,v \in W$. We need to find an element $w \in W$ with $u \leq w$ and $v \leq w$. For that, we induce on $r = l(u) + l(w)$. For $r = 0$ we have $u = v = e$ and can choose $w = e$. So let $r > 0$. Because of symmetry we can assume $l(u) > 0$, hence $u \neq e$ and so there is a $s \in S$ with $us < u$. By induction hypothesis there is a $w \in W$ with $us \leq w$ and  $v \leq w$. Consider two cases:

		\begin{description}
			\item[$ws < w$:] Then $s \in D_R(w)$ and with \ref{theo:lifting-property} we have $u = uss \leq w$, so both $u \leq w$ and $v \leq w$.
			\item[$ws > w$:] Then $s \in D_R(w s)$ and $u s \leq w < w s$, hence again by \ref{theo:lifting-property} we have $u = uss \leq w s$, so both $u \leq ws$ and $v \leq w < ws$. \qedhere
		\end{description}
	\end{proof}
\end{prop}

\begin{coro}
	\typedlabel{coro:bruhat-is-bounded}
	\theocite{Proposition 8}{denton:coxeter}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Let $W$ be finite, then there exists an unique element $w_0 \in W$ with $w \leq w_0$ for all $w \in W$.
		\item If $W$ contains an element $w$, with $D_R(w) = S$, then $W$ is finite and $w$ is the unique element $w_0$.
	\end{enumerate}

	\begin{proof}
		\proofcite{Proposition 8}{denton:coxeter}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Assume there are two elements $u,v \in W $ of maximal rank. Since $\Br(W)$ is directed, there is an element $w \in W$ with $u \leq w$ and $v \leq w$. Because $\Br(W)$ is graded, we have $l(w) > l(u) = l(v)$, contradicting to the maximality of $u$ and $v$.
			\item We want to show, that $v < w$ for all $v \in W$. For that, we induce on $r = l(v)$. If $r = 0$, then $v = e \leq w$. Let $r > 0$. Then there is a $s \in S$ with $us < u$. By induction, $us \leq w$. Since $s \in D_R(w)$, we have $uss = u \leq w$ by \ref{theo:lifting-property} and are done with our induction. This yields $W = [e,w]$ and since by \ref{coro:bruhat-intervals-are-finite} intervals in the Bruhat order are finite, $W$ is finite, too. \qedhere
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proof}
\end{coro}

\begin{coro}
	Let $(W,S)$ be a finite Coxeter system. Then $\Br(W)$ is graded, directed and bounded.

	\begin{proof}
		$\Br(W)$ is graded due to \ref{coro:bruhat-ordering-is-graded}, directed due to \ref{prop:bruhat-is-directed} and bounded due to \ref{coro:bruhat-is-bounded}.
	\end{proof}
\end{coro}

\begin{coro}
	Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system and $w,v \in W$ with $w < v$. Then the interval $[w,v]$ is a finite, graded, directed and bounded poset.

	\begin{proof}
		The poset structure and the graduation transfers directly from $Br(W)$. By \ref{coro:bruhat-intervals-are-finite} intervals in $\Br(W)$ are finite. Since $v$ is the unique maximal element and $w$ the unique minimal element, it is bounded. By definition of intervals we have $u \leq v$ for every element $u \in [w,v]$, hence it is directed.
	\end{proof}
\end{coro}
