\chapter{Application}
\label{sec:application}

In this section we use our results on the twisted weak ordering to conclude a certain structural property for some geometrical structures. Namely, we introduce chambers systems and a specialization of them, buildings that receive structure by an underlying Coxeter system $(W,S)$. Buildings then yield another generalization, the twin buildings for which we investigate properties of certain involutory maps. These maps, called building (quasi-)flips admit an involutive Coxeter system automorphism for $(W,S)$. The intended application of our results then applies to so-called flip-flop systems admitted by a twin building and a building quasi-flip. This section is heavily based on \cite{horn:kac-moody}, but we will only introduce the bare minimum needed for our purposes. So for more details refer to \cite{horn:kac-moody}.
